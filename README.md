### 🌐 Decentralized Exchange Platform 🌐

Welcome to the Decentralized Exchange Platform project! This project is focusing on creating a fully functional decentralized application (dApp) on EVM blockchain. The project involves the use of Next.js for the front end, a Go API connected to a postgreSQL database with Prisma for the backend, and Foundry for smart contract development. Docker is used for containerization.
